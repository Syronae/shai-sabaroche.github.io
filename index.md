## About Me
I am a **Mechanical Engineer** with a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from **Rutgers University**. My research spans solid mechanics, vibrations, acoustics, fracture mechanics, and autonomous systems, with a focus on **finite element analysis (FEA)**, **material characterization**, and **robotics**. With a strong foundation in analytical modeling, I have worked on various cutting-edge projects involving **ophthalmic biomechanics** and **robotic systems**.

### My Areas of Expertise:
- **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)**
- **Fracture Mechanics & Material Characterization**
- **Solid Mechanics & Vibrations**
- **Autonomous Systems Design**
- **Robotics (Pathfinding & Control Systems)**
- **Data Modeling & Algorithm Development**
- **Programming (MATLAB, Python, C++)**
- **CAD Modeling (SolidWorks, Ansys, AutoCAD)**

I am passionate about applying engineering principles to solve real-world challenges and advancing technology in fields such as aerospace and biomechanics.
