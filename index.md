title: "Shai S. Sabaroche – Mechanical Engineer & Researcher"
---

## About Me
I am a **Mechanical Engineer** with a Ph.D from **Rutgers University** whose work bridges analytical mechanics, numerical simulation, and hands‑on prototyping.  

My doctoral dissertation develops a first‑principles, mechanics‑based model of **retinal detachment precipitated by blunt‑force ocular trauma**, unifying thin‑shell theory, viscoelastic continua, and spectral methods to predict when and how vision‑threatening delamination propagates.  
Beyond biomechanics, I design robotic and mechatronic systems—including a fleet of holonomic plant‑care robots—and teach undergraduate laboratories in vibrations and solid mechanics.

## Core Technical Competencies
- Finite‑Element Analysis (**ANSYS**, **Abaqus**), spectral & modal methods  
- Fracture & fatigue mechanics, energy‑release‑rate criteria  
- CAD & digital fabrication (**SolidWorks**, **AutoCAD**, rapid‑prototyping)  
- Robotics & controls (C++, Arduino, PID & A* path‑finding)  
- Scientific computing (**MATLAB**, **Python**, Mathematica, Maple)

## Featured Projects
1. **Mechanics of Retinal Detachment** – PhD research modelling traumatic and tractional detachments and mapping stability envelopes. → [Read more](retinal-detachment/)
2. **IndaPlants Experiment** – a networked trio of holonomic robots that cooperatively irrigate and reposition houseplants to maximise growth. → [Read more](indaplants/)
3. **Rotation‑Induced Beam‑Plate Detachment** – variational study of delamination in rotating laminates. → [Read more](rotation-beam-detachment/)
