## 1. **IndaPlants Experiment: Autonomous Robots for Agricultural Optimization**
This project involved the design and implementation of **autonomous holonomic robots** that optimize plant life through coordinated motion and resource sharing. The robots communicate via **XBee S2 modules** in a **ZigBee mesh network** for real-time coordination, and use **PID control** for drift correction.

### Key Features:
- **C++ Programming**: Developed the motion control algorithms for the robots, optimizing their movement and coordination.
- **Pathfinding**: Implemented the **A* algorithm** for grid-based pathfinding to efficiently navigate the environment.
- **Resource Sharing**: Programmed robots to autonomously share resources such as water and nutrients to optimize plant health.
- **Technologies Used**: Arduino microcontrollers, XBee S2 modules, PID control, A* pathfinding algorithm.

### Achievements:
- Successfully optimized plant life by designing an intelligent, autonomous system capable of adjusting to environmental factors in real time.
- Integrated wireless communication to enable coordination between multiple robots.

## 2. **Retinal Detachment Modeling: Biomechanics and Fracture Analysis**
My research focused on **retinal detachment** due to **low-velocity blunt force impacts**. I studied the propagation of detachment using **spectral expansion** for modal analysis and employed **Griffith-type fracture criteria** to understand delamination in the retina.

### Key Features:
- **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)**: Applied FEA to model and simulate the mechanical behavior of the retina under blunt force impact.
- **Fracture Mechanics**: Used **Griffith fracture criterion** to analyze detachment propagation and identify the initiation of damage in the retina.
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Worked with boundary value problems and modal analysis techniques to analyze stress and strain in the retinal tissue.

### Achievements:
- Developed a deeper understanding of the mechanical behavior of the retina, contributing to improved models for ocular injury prevention.
- Provided valuable insights for surgical interventions aimed at preventing or repairing retinal detachment.

## 3. **Rotation-Induced Detachment of Elastic Beam-Plate from Fibril Medium**
This research focused on the **rotation-induced detachment** of an eccentrically cantilevered **elastic beam-plate** from a **fibril medium**. The study investigated how various excitations affect detachment propagation.

### Key Features:
- **Analytical Modeling**: Modeled the detachment process under different rotational and force conditions.
- **Comparison with Ophthalmic Models**: Compared results with **posterior vitreous detachment (PVD)** models to understand similar detachment mechanisms in the eye.
- **Numerical Simulations**: Performed simulations using MATLAB to analyze the behavior of the system under rotational stresses.

### Achievements:
- Contributed to understanding the mechanics of detachment in flexible structures, with applications in both **biomechanics** and **material science**.
