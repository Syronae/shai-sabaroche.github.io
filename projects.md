## Mechanics of Retinal Detachment (PhD Dissertation)
Axisymmetric eye model coupling a viscoelastic vitreous body to thin‑shell retina and sclera to analyse detachment growth after low‑velocity impact.

**Key Features**
* Kirchoff–Love thin‑shell formulation for retina and sclera.
* Propagating‑boundary variational fracture criterion gives energy‑release rate \(G(a,t)\).
* Spectral solver using spherical Bessel and Legendre modes.

**Achievements**
* Identified a peak in \(G\) for small detachments, clarifying why early “watch‑and‑wait” cases can fail.
* Presented preliminary results at the Joint Mathematics Meetings and the MSRI Special Session on Mathematical Modeling and Analysis in Eye Research.
* Dissertation defended and degree conferred.

**Technologies**  
Analytical mechanics, MATLAB spectral code.

## IndaPlants
A swarm of holonomic robots that map, share, and service light, water, and humidity resources to support potted plants in an indoor arena.

**Key Features**
* Triangular aluminium chassis with three omni‑wheels and encoder‑calibrated PID control.
* Multi‑sensor fusion (Pixy CMU‑cam, sonar ring, sunlight, humidity & soil‑moisture probes).
* Grid‑based A* path‑planning and **API‑mode ZigBee mesh** for resource exchange.

**Achievements**
* Swarm trials reported **35 %** longer soil‑moisture retention and a **12 %** bump in leaf‑area index versus single‑robot control.
* Full 8 × 12 ft arena mapped in **88 s** (3‑robot swarm) versus 190 s single‑robot baseline.

**Technologies**  
C++ on Arduino Mega 2560, XBee S2 radio modules, custom motor‑driver PCB, PyQt5 dashboard.

## Rotation‑Induced Beam‑Plate Detachment Study
Variational and modal‑analysis investigation of an eccentrically cantilevered beam‑plate peeling from a Winkler foundation inside a rotating housing.

**Key Features**
* Transversality condition links foundation stiffness, angular acceleration, and adhesion energy.
* Closed‑form natural‑frequency set nearly invariant with detached length.
* Comparative analysis of impulse, harmonic, and saccadic spin profiles.

**Achievements**
* Safe‑operating envelope derived for industrial laminates; catastrophic regime under eye‑like saccades noted as a biomechanical analogue.

**Technologies**  
Calculus of variations, MATLAB modal solver, analytic post‑processing.
